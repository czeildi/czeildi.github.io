---

My name is Ildi Czeller and I work as a Data Scientist at Emarsys in the Budapest office since I graduated as a mathematician from ELTE. Besides my work at Emarsys I am a mentor and organizer at [Techcamp](http://techtabor.agondolkodasorome.hu/). I am also a proud alumna and supporter of [The Joy of Thinking Foundation](http://agondolkodasorome.hu/en/).
