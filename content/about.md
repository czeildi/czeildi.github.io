---



My name is Ildi Czeller and I work as a Software Engineer at [Emarsys](https://emarsys.com/) in the Budapest office. Previously I was part of the Data Science team there, since I graduated as a mathematician from [ELTE](https://www.elte.hu/en/). Besides my work at Emarsys I am a mentor and organizer at [Techcamp](http://techtabor.agondolkodasorome.hu/). I am also a proud alumna and supporter of [The Joy of Thinking Foundation](http://agondolkodasorome.hu/en/).
