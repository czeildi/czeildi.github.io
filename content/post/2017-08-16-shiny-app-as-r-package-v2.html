<p>In my previous <a href="https://www.ildiczeller.com/2017/08/09/shiny-app-as-r-package/">post</a> I explored the possibility of wrapping a shiny app as an R package. I falsely stated that you cannot have a directory-based shiny app with <code>global.R</code>. Based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37830819/developing-shiny-app-as-a-package-and-deploying-it-to-shiny-server">this</a> question on Stack Overflow I proved the contrary. It is actually possible but with serious limitations in my opinion so I still strongly advise the function based approach.</p>
<p>You can put basically anything in the <code>inst</code> folder of your package and use those as is. I.e. you can put your regular <code>server.R</code>, <code>ui.R</code> and <code>global.R</code> files to <code>inst</code> and have an exported launcher function in <code>R</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#&#39; @export
runShinyPackageApp &lt;- function(...) {
    shiny::runApp(
        appDir = system.file(&quot;.&quot;, package = &quot;shinypackageapp&quot;),
        ...
    )
}</code></pre>
<div id="obstacles-i-ran-into" class="section level2">
<h2>Obstacles I ran into</h2>
<ul>
<li>You cannot simply use functions from imported packages unless you explicitly call <code>library(dependecy_package)</code> in <code>server.R</code> or <code>global.R</code>.</li>
<li>If you create utility functions you cannot used them unless they are exported and you call <code>library(shinypackageapp)</code> before <code>runShinyPackageApp()</code>.</li>
<li>You cannot access internal package data in the <code>server.R</code> or <code>ui.R</code> files unless you have an exported function to access your package data.</li>
<li>You cannot access the file system regularly, if you check the contents of your default folder in <code>server.R</code> you will see something similar:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>DESCRIPTION
global.R
help
html
INDEX
LICENSE
Meta
NAMESPACE
R
server.R
ui.R</code></pre>
<p>I suspect this is some kind of temp location of the installed package, certainly not the root folder of my project, neither the root folder of the package as I see it during package development.</p>
<p>All the aboves are due to the fact that these files are not compiled in any way but partly pretend to exist in the folder where you installed the package.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Besides distribution you loose most of the positive sides of wrapping your app in a package this way.</p>
<p>You can see the the whole code on <a href="https://github.com/czeildi/shinypackageapp">github</a> and try for yourselves with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(
    &quot;czeildi/shinypackageapp&quot;, ref = &quot;v0.4.0&quot;
)</code></pre>
</div>
