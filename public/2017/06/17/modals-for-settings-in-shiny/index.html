      <p>For some time I have been wondering about the best way to hide more advanced settings from the regular user of your app. I have some apps with many different filters and options, all of which I want to keep because they have their legitimate usage. However, they take up valuable space and also confuse the user who does not need advanced options at the moment.</p>
<p>I also learned about the possibility of using modals and wondered whether there is a use case waiting to be solved.</p>
<p>I came up with using modals to only show advanced options on request. I am not perfectly happy with the solution, however I learned a lot from doing it so I decided to share it.</p>
<p>I built a dead simple shiny app which you can find here alongside the code: <a href="https://ildi-czeller.shinyapps.io/persistent_modal/">persistent modal shiny example</a>.</p>
<p>The most important thing to solve was to keep the set values of advanced options between reopenings of the modal. I solved this with reactive values.</p>
<p>What I did not manage to solve was to apply those advanced options if and only if the user explicitly asks for applying them. I can either change them upon every modification, or upon opening the modal or pressing the apply button. But this is good enough for now. Any suggestions are welcome.</p>
