Last week I was lucky enough to participate in this year&amp;rsquo;s Ropensci unconference.
In my work as a Data Scientist at Emarsys I rely on the R ecosystem a lot. I feel that to contribute back is not only fun and challenging but also my responsibility as I already benefit enormously from the FOSS tools and supportive community. I have had small contributions like filing a bug ticket or reviewing a package for rOpenSci and they were positive experiences.</description>
