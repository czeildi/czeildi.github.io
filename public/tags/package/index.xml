      <description>Background I love and use shiny regularly and I also try to modularize my work more and more. Naturally I started to wonder whether I could have a whole shiny app as an R package and then possibly a project organizing multiple apps together. The answer is yes as I suspected.
Several others already wrote about the topic, including Dean Attali and William Landau. However, I gained a deeper understanding by trying things out myself.</description>
