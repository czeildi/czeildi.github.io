      <description>Motivation At Emarsys we have several internal private R packages which are essential to our day-to-day work. They are also under constant development. We want to work on these in a collaborative and safe way. Fast and trustworthy CI &amp;amp; CD are essential: they reduce the cost and risk of adding a small but useful feature to one of our packages.
Although in the R community Travis is the standard for CI, at Emarsys the whole company uses Codeship happily so we wanted to give it a go.</description>
