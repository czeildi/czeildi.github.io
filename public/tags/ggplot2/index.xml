      <description>I spoke about custom ggplot2 themes at the last BURN meetup. My slides are available here but I will give you a somewhat extended summary here. A custom theme could come in handy both in academia and industry to ensure a consistent style.

      <description>I have made several plots with ggplot2 in the past 2 years and occasionally got errors related to the group aesthetics. I solved these issues without once taking the time to fully understand how the group aesthetic works. This blogpost is a result of my experiments to finally explore how it works. My understanding is a combination of my experiments and Hadley Wickhams outstanding book about ggplot2. (https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book)
Scenario 1: mapping based on one variable Our dummy data will be a unit square.</description>
