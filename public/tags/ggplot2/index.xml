      <description>I have been using ggplot2 quite extensively for two years now but I still learn new things from reading and re-reading Hadley Wickhamsâ€™s ggplot2 book. Here are some examples.
library(&amp;quot;ggplot2&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;magrittr&amp;quot;) You not only can have free scales with facetting but also free space. This is especially useful with discrete axis.

My understanding is a combination of my experiments and Hadley Wickhams outstanding book about ggplot2. (https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book)
