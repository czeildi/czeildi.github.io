      <description>Background I love and use shiny regularly and I also try to modularize my work more and more. Naturally I started to wonder whether I could have a whole shiny app as an R package and then possibly a project organizing multiple apps together. The answer is yes as I suspected.
Several others already wrote about the topic, including Dean Attali and William Landau. However, I gained a deeper understanding by trying things out myself.</description>

      <description>For some time I have been wondering about the best way to hide more advanced settings from the regular user of your app. I have some apps with many different filters and options, all of which I want to keep because they have their legitimate usage. However, they take up valuable space and also confuse the user who does not need advanced options at the moment.
I also learned about the possibility of using modals and wondered whether there is a use case waiting to be solved.</description>
