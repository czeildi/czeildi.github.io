## Warning: package &amp;#39;data.table&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.5.2 It caused me a great deal of headache to work around as.difftime to get what I wanted but also I learned much more than I expected along the way so I wanted to share the journey with you.
Initial experience I had a data frame with two columns containing timestamps and I wanted to calculate the difference between them.</description>
